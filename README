Simple Git Migration Script
=============================================================

Description
-------------------------------------------------------------

This script will convert projects stored in SVN with the following format:

trunk/project1
trunk/project2
branch/branch4project1 or branches/branch4project1

Each project will get synchronized over by project name:

Ex: ./migration https://svnurl.com/path project1

The final repository is converted over to a bare git repository.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------

- SVN
- Native Git

Usage

Ex: ./migration https://svnurl.com/path

Open the the commiters list file and add email address. Change the following format:

jhuntley = jhuntley <jhuntley>

To:

jhuntley = jhuntley <onepremise@gmail.com>

Each project will get synchronized over by project name:

Ex: ./migration https://svnurl.com/path project1
