Simple Git Migration Script
=============================================================

Description
-------------------------------------------------------------

This script will convert projects stored in SVN with the following format:

/trunk
      /Project1
      /Project2
/branches
         /Project1
         /Project2
/tags
     /Project1
     /Project2
     
This scheme is also popular and supported as well:

/Project1
         /trunk
         /branches
         /tags
/Project2
         /trunk
         /branches
         /tags

Each project will get synchronized over by project name:

Ex: ./migration https://svnurl.com/basepath project1

If you wish to convert the full repo over, use the following syntax:

Ex: ./migration https://svnurl.com/basepath .

The final repository is converted over to a bare git repository.
